📊 DataDigest – AI File Summarizer

[DataDigest is built to be your intelligent assistant that handles the “reading part”,so you can focus on the “thinking part.”]

How much time teams spend manually reading and interpreting long business reports, feedback files, and Excel summaries???

This made me realize how repetitive and inefficient this task really is.

Later, while discussing the concept with my professor, we talked about the growing role of AI in automating knowledge extraction, and how summarization models could bridge that exact gap.

And that’s how DataDigest came to life, An AI-powered tool that can read, understand, and summarize multi-format business documents in seconds.

This project combines my curiosity for Natural Language Processing (NLP) with practical, real-world problems faced by professionals every day.

🔷 Why I Built This

In most organizations, people spend hours every week reading raw Excel reports, lengthy Word documents, and unstructured feedback files,just to pull out key takeaways.

I wanted to build something that:

-Saves time by automating report analysis
